# Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

## Overview
Welcome to the **Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision** repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and project files from the WorldQuant University (WQU) Applied AI Lab, focusing on real-world applications of deep learning in computer vision.

## About the Course
**Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision** is a hands-on program designed to teach essential deep learning skills through practical applications in computer vision. This program provides students with experience in cleaning and transforming visual data, training custom models, and deploying advanced computer vision techniques.

### Why Computer Vision?
Computer vision is one of the most accessible and impactful fields of deep learning. Its applications span multiple industries, including:
- **Healthcare** (Medical imaging diagnostics)
- **Agriculture** (Monitoring crop health)
- **Security** (Surveillance and biometrics)
- **Transportation** (Traffic monitoring)

This lab allows learners to develop an end-to-end understanding of computer vision, from data preparation to model deployment.

## Course Curriculum & Projects
The program consists of six real-world projects, each designed to teach specific aspects of computer vision:

1. **Wildlife Tracking in CÃ´te d'Ivoire**  
   - Assess a dataset from a wildlife preserve and apply deep learning techniques to track animal movements.
2. **Crop Disease Classification in Uganda**  
   - Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify crop diseases.
3. **Traffic Flow Monitoring in Dhaka, Bangladesh**  
   - Develop an object detection model to analyze traffic patterns.
4. **Face Detection and Recognition**  
   - Perform face detection and recognition using video footage of Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom.
5. **Medical Image Generation**  
   - Use neural networks to generate and enhance medical images.
6. **AI-Powered Meme Generator**  
   - Implement a stable diffusion model to create and deploy a meme generator app on Streamlit.

### Completed Projects
